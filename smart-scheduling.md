# ✨ Feature Suggestion: Smart Email Scheduling

## Summary
Introduce a "Smart Schedule" feature that allows TonePilot to automatically send AI-generated replies based on the recipient’s local time zone or engagement patterns.

## Problem
Many emails are sent at suboptimal times — late at night, during weekends, or outside the recipient’s working hours — reducing open and response rates.

## Proposed Solution
Enable users to toggle a “Smart Send” option when generating replies. This feature would:
- Detect the recipient’s time zone from email headers or metadata
- Suggest or automatically select an optimal send time based on common business hours
- Optionally integrate with the sender’s calendar to avoid conflicts

## User Benefits
- Increases chances of email being seen and responded to
- Demonstrates professionalism and respect for time zones
- Reduces need for manual scheduling

## Technical Notes
- Time zone detection could use IP, domain, or mail server data
- Future enhancement: integrate ML model to learn per-recipient engagement windows

## Priority
🌟 Nice-to-have — but high value for international users and sales teams
